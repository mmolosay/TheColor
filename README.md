## What is it

This project showcases my expertise in developing software in general and
native Android apps in specific.
Originally, it served as a playground, a safe environment to try new things in Android world.
Over the course of years, it evolved into a polished, comprehensive app that I'm proud to share.

I would be flattered if other developers find inspiration in this software, its approaches and 
solutions.
It has open-source code and full commit history, so anyone can trace my decisions and the app's development journey.
